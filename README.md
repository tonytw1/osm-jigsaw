## OpenStreetMap Jigsaw

Gecoding is the art turning a location point into a human readable name (and vice versa).
(ie. 51.0, -0.3 <--> London, United Kingdon).

Nominatim is the default OpenStreetMap geocoding solution.
It does are really great job of interpreting an implied structure and using it to construct sensible geocodings.

Nominatim uses a Postgres database populated with the entire OpenStreetMap dataset.
This can be operationally challenging for a number of reasons including:

- A full import requires alot of storage (~1TB of SSD disk)
- An initial import of the full dataset can take a long time (days).
- The long lead time means that the database tends to become a permanent fixture rather than a disposable cloud citizen.
- Important parts of the Nominatim code are implemented as a Postgres module making it more difficult to alter.
- Cloud deployments are prohibitively expensive.

Is it possible to approach this problem from a more stateless angle?
Can we transform a raw OSM data extract into a structured graph in application code without having to import a database?


### Considerations

The OpenStreetMap data model is a fairly unstructured, flat format. The implied structure comes from a loosely applied hierarchy of tags.
The full dataset contains around 5 billion entities is in the region of 60Gb compressed.

These considerations come to mind:

- Minimise preprocessing by using the existing OSM extract format as input (likely the compressed .pbf format)

- Try not to use local knowledge. 
ie. The system should infer that England and Wales are inside the United Kingdom and that Yosemite National Park is in California from the shape of the data rather than hardcoded rules or
human intervention.

- Try to defer decision making; try to avoid discarding information or baking decisions into the structure too early; try to produce a structure which allows for the rendering to vary at runtime.

    ie. There could be multiple valid representions where an areas sits.
    London -> United Kingdom
    London -> Greater London -> England -> United Kingdom.

    Even if the former is the desired output, the graph should represent all of the possible paths so that the consumer is free to change it's mind at runtime.

- We're happy to live without partial updates so long as a full update can be performed in a reasonable timeframe (hours not days).

- It should be possible to process a full planet file on a reasonably well equipped developer machine (say 32Gb of RAM).


### Proposed approach

Starting with a raw OSM extract file, preform a number of independant steps to transform the extract into the desired output format.


#### 1) Extract interesting entities from the input file

To get the dataset down to managable size, extract any OSM entities which might represent areas into a working file.

Take all of the relations and the ways which are marked as closed.
Discard any entities which do not have name tags.
Collect the sub relations, ways and nodes which make up these entities.

Some relations have sub relations which form circular references; we should ignore these.

This step might take the 1Gb Great Britain extract down to something more like 50Mb.


#### 2) Resolve relations and closed ways into areas

Attempt to build closed shapes from the filtered entities.

Relations may be composed multiple ways and sub relations which will need to be resolved.
A single relation might represent multiple areas (ie. a group of islands).

Ways within a relation might not always be in sequential order. 
Ways within an area's outline may be pointing in different directions. A certain amount of trail and error might be needed.

Output the resolved areas in an unsorted file.


#### 3) Sort the areas into a hierarchy

Much like a gravel sorting sieve. Smaller areas should fall down into larger areas. More important relations like countries should float to the top.
The resulting structure will look vaguely like a heap with each child node representing an area which fits inside it's parent.

ie.
England should be a child of United Kingdom after sorting.
Bournemouth should be a descendant of England.

Output the graph in a format which can be sensibly parsed by a consumer.


### Usage

#### Compiling
This is a Scala / sbt project. Install sbt and build a jar file.

```
sbt clean assembly
```


#### Processing an extract file

Obtain a planet.osm extract (user the protobuffer .pbf format).

##### 1) Split the extract file

An OSM extract seems to list nodes, ways and then relations. This is not the optimal ordering for our workflow.
There are gains to be had by spliting the extract file by entity type to save time spent scanning past entites
we are not interested in.

```
input="ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717"
jarfile="target/scala/osm-jigsaw-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
java -jar $jarfile -s split $input.osm.pbf
```

This should produce 3 new files:

```
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.osm.pbf.nodes
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.osm.pbf.relations
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.osm.pbf.ways
```


##### 2) Extract the entities which represent areas

```
java -Xmx16G -jar $jarfile -s extract $input.osm.pbf $input.rels.pbf
```

The heap sizes have been choosen for a full planet extract on a machine with 32Gb of RAM.

This step should produce 3 more files:

```
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.rels.pbf
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.rels.pbf.nodes.vol
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.rels.pbf.ways.vol
```

#### 3) Build areas from the extracted entities

```
java -Xmx16G -jar $jarfile -s areas $input.rels.pbf $input.areas.pbf
```

#### 4) Sort the areas into a graph

```
java -Xmx28G -jar $jarfile -s graph $input.areas.pbf $input.graph.pbf
```

The step may take some time (approximately 4 hours for a full planet extract).


#### 5) Extract the tags for areas

Extracts the OSM tags for the entities which produced areas. This allows name for the areas to be derived at runtime.

```
java -jar $jarfile -s tags $input.rels.pbf $input.tags.pbf
```

On completion you should have 3 files representing the extracted, sorted areas.

```
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.areas.pbf
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.graph.pbf
ireland-and-northern-ireland-180717.tags.pbf
```

The 3 files are in protobuffer format and contain [OutputArea](src/main/protobuf/outputarea.proto), [OutputGraphNode](src/main/protobuf/outputgraphnode.proto) and [OutputTagging](src/main/protobuf/outputtagging.proto) objects.

These 3 files should be placed in a location where they are accessible to the [OSM Jigsaw API](https://github.com/tonytw1/osm-jigsaw-api).


### Progress

Full extract runs to completion on a machine with 32Gb of RAM producing 9 million areas and a graph contain 19 million nodes.
The resulting graph can be loaded into a JVM with 30Gb of heap.
The API can resolve a reverse query in around 30ms.

###Â Results

This approach to geocoding does well for some use cases and less so for others.
This is a reflection of the importance of node points such as cities and neighborhoods in the OpenStreetMap data; the area based approach neglects these points.

Richmond Park
Nicely illustrates that Richmond Park is a large area which falls across multiple London boroughs.

Twickenham Rowing Club
Correctly places the rowing club on the Eel Pie Island matching it's colloquial address.

Yosemite National Park
Correctly placed in California.

Perth, Australia
The lack of an enclosing city area means that Perth is not mentioned in results. 

Bournemouth Pier
Interesting outlier; the pier sits just outside of the local authority and county boundaries, losing locality.
